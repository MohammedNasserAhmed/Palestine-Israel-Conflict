## :dart: Introduction ##

The "Human Cost of Palestine-Israel Conflict 2000 - 2023" is a data analytics project that aims to analyze the data of the conflict to help people understand the situation and read the conflict from a more insightful view. The conflict between Israel and Palestine dates back to the end of the nineteenth century, and it has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced many millions of people. The data source for this project is the United Nations (OH).

The project includes multiple types of charts, such as heatmaps, bars, stacked bars, pie charts, histograms, and more. To create these visualizations, we used Python libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, Bokeh, and Plotly. These libraries offer different features and strengths that make them suitable for different types of visualizations. For example, Seaborn is a Python plotting library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a higher-level API, making it easier to create more complex visualizations with less code. Bokeh and Plotly, on the other hand, are both open-source libraries that allow users to create interactive and dynamic visualizations.

The dataset used in this project has only four columns and features: Year, Month, Palestinians Killed, Israelis Killed, Palestinians Injuries, and Israelis Injuries. The dataset has no details about children or women.
In this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the conflict and its impact on human lives. The following sections of this README file will provide more details about the project, including the methodology used, the visualizations created, and the insights gained from the analysis.

## :rocket: Methodology ##

To analyze the data, we first cleaned and preprocessed it to ensure that it was in a format suitable for analysis. We then used Python libraries such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, Bokeh, and Plotly to create various types of visualizations, including heatmaps, bars, stacked bars, pie charts, histograms, and more.

## :white_check_mark: Visualizations ##

The visualizations created in this project provide a comprehensive view of the conflict and its impact on human lives. Some of the visualizations created include:
* Heatmaps 
* Bar charts 
* Stacked bar charts 
* Pie charts
* Scatter charts
  
## :checkered_flag: Insights ##

The analysis of the data revealed several insights about the conflict and its impact on human lives. For example, the data showed that the conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced many millions of people. The data also showed that the number of Palestinians and Israelis killed and injured has varied over time, with some years seeing a higher number of casualties than others.

Overall, the "Human Cost of Palestine-Israel Conflict 2000 - 2023" project provides a comprehensive analysis of the conflict and its impact on human lives. The visualizations created in this project help people understand the situation and read the conflict from a more insightful view.
